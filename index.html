    <h1><b><u>2025 Toyota GR86</u></b></h1>
    <h2><u>Overview</u></h2>
    <p>The Toyota GR86 is proof you can still have fun on budget. A diminutive coupe with comically tiny rear seats, a 228-hp
    flat-four engine, rear-wheel drive, and a manual transmission, the GR86 walks a straight path through a world built on
    compromise. But its back-to-basics appeal and the pure driving experience it delivers pay dividends that reach far past
    the corporate focus groups, not to mention its spec sheet. The GR86's attractive styling, sharp steering, and deft
    handling are refreshing reminders of a time before assisted driving was the norm. Despite its tiny footprint, the cabin
    is spacious enough—for the front passengers, anyway—and the controls are ideally placed. Outside of its mechanical twin,
    the Subaru BRZ, it has very few natural competitors other than the Mazda Miata, which serves as its long-term foil. But
    when it comes to nailing the excitement-versus-price equation, the GR86 remains one of the best options available and
    earns a spot on our 2025 10Best list as a result. As one of our favorites in its segment, the Toyota GR86 has also
    earned a spot on our Editors’ Choice list for 2025.</p>

    <h2><u>What's New for 2025</u></h2>
    <p>Toyota is reviving the Hakone special edition that first appeared as limited-edition run back in 2020. Based on the
    Premium trim, it includes the same Performance Pack that was introduced with last year's Trueno edition, comprising
    Sachs dampers and Brembo brakes with larger-diameter rotors, and a choice of either a manual or automatic transmission.
    Unique colors and 18-inch wheels are also part of the package, which is limited to 860 examples. The rest of the GR86
    lineup gets retuned shock absorbers and electric power steering, as well as reworked throttle mapping for easier
    rev-matching action.</p>

            <td>Hakone Edition</td>
            <td>$36,405</td>
        </tr>
    </table>
    <p>We've previously enjoyed the Premium trim, as its heated seats, stylish 18-inch wheels with summer performance tires,
    adaptive LED headlights, and improved eight-speaker audio system make the marginal increase a killer deal. But in this
    case, it's hard to ignore the exclusivity and mechanical upgrades of the Hakone, tipping the scales in its favor. The
    six-speed manual transmission is an obvious choice here, too.</p>

    <h2><u>Engine, Transmission, and Performance</u></h2>
    <p>The GR86 comes with a naturally aspirated 228-hp 2.4-liter horizontally opposed four-cylinder from Subaru. It's not a
    wild beast by any measure, but it's more powerful and refined than the first-gen 2.0-liter version. Both solid and
    balanced, the flat-four operates well within the limits of the chassis. During our first test drive, we noted that the
    more powerful engine felt livelier and sounded better, while the car's razor-sharp handling provided thrills both on the
    road and on the Monticello Motor Club racetrack. Despite the car's handling prowess, the suspension is forgiving enough
    to function as a daily driver.</p>

    <h2><u>0-60 Times</u></h2>
    <p>Though the first-generation GR86 was a bit pokey at 6.2 seconds to 60 mph, the second-generation GR86 posted a
    5.4-second time to 60 mph and knocked off the quarter-mile in 14.0 seconds. Credit the improvement to the more powerful
    second-generation engine. A six-speed manual serves as the GR86's standard and preferred transmission; a six-speed
    automatic is available but is 0.7 second slower to 60 mph.</p>

    <h2><u>Fuel Economy and Real-World MPG</u></h2>
    <p>The EPA estimates the Toyota GR86 can return 21 mpg in the city and 31 mpg on the highway when optioned with the
    six-speed automatic transmission. GR86s using the six-speed manual get slightly lower EPA numbers at 20 mpg in the city
    and 27 mpg on the highway. When we get a chance to put the new model through our 200-mile highway fuel-economy test, we
    will update this story with the results. For more information about the 86's fuel economy, visit the EPA's website.</p>

    <h2><u>Interior, Comfort, and Cargo</u></h2>
    <p>The GR86's interior has evolved slightly from the first generation, but it hasn't grown measurably larger. Like the
    Subaru BRZ, the GR86 is unique in the affordable-sports-car market in that they offer seating for four. That comes with
    a huge asterisk, however, as the rear seats are truly lilliputian and are best reserved for backpacks and groceries.
    That said, the front passenger compartment is surprisingly accommodating, and the steering-wheel-to-shifter relationship
    is ideal for spirited driving. As before, the Subaru and Toyota models appear to share their interiors, save for some
    changes on the dashboard surrounding the infotainment display.</p>

    <h2><u>Infotainment and Connectivity</u></h2>
    <p>An 8.0-inch infotainment touchscreen is standard. The GR86 also comes with a 7.0-inch digital gauge display that is
    reconfigurable with Normal, Sport, and Track modes. Apple CarPlay and Android Auto capability are both standard, and all
    models come with SiriusXM satellite radio with a free three-month trial. The base model comes with a six-speaker stereo,
    but the upgraded Premium trim comes with an eight-speaker setup.</p>

    <h2><u>Safety and Driver-Assistance Features</u></h2>
    <p>Toyota provides a suite of driver-assistance features and safety technologies on the 2024 model. For more information
    about the GR86's crash-test results, visit the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) and Insurance
    Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS) websites. Key safety features are likely to include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Standard automated emergency braking</li>
        <li>Standard lane-departure warning</li>
        <li>Standard adaptive cruise control</li>
    </ul>

    <h2><u>Warranty and Maintenance Coverage</u></h2>
    <p>The GR86's standard warranty package consists of three-year/36,000-mile bumper-to-bumper coverage and powertrain
    coverage that stretches to five years or 60,000 miles. Toyota's two-year complimentary maintenance policy is a nice perk
    that the BRZ and the Mazda MX-5 Miata don't match. All buyers also receive a free one-year membership to the National
    Auto Sport Association and free admission to one of that organization's High Performance Driving Events.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Limited warranty covers three years or 36,000 miles</li>
        <li>Powertrain warranty covers five years or 60,000 miles</li>
        <li>Complimentary maintenance is covered for two years or 25,000 miles</li>
    </ul>
